gorgale's auto-rice & security-testing installer script

This script is meant for my own personal use, in order to maintain the same workflow and appearance across multiple systems.

Why not GNU Stow? Because, I like to do everything in my power to avoid third-parties as much as possible.

This script is built with MY systems and MY configurations in mind, do NOT assume that it will instantly work on your own machines.
I am NOT responsible if you are unsure of yourself and damage your machine in an attempt to use this.
